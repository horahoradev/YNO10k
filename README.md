This is a server for easyrpg multiplayer that I wrote a while back; it can be used for e.g. yume 2kki/yume nikki multiplayer, or various other games. It's mostly fully-functional, but I lost interest in the project and dropped it.

## Attributions
This server uses the protocol defined originally by charx61 in the following repos:
1. https://gitlab.com/CataractJustice/YNOnline/
2. https://github.com/CataractJustice/ynoclient

I also took several files (e.g. javascript) from the above server.
